# R_MyVetfolio
 
Hi!!! Welcome to MyVetfolio. That's not just a regular portfolio. Here you can find such as my professional veterinarian career infos, but also a bunch of informations about the vet world itself.

## How does it works?

Here you can navegate through all pages, most specifically, my portfolio, some fun facts about the vet world, send me messages if you have any question about anything, informative stuff about vet medicine and much more. Also, there could be implemented other funcionalities in the future.
First of all, as soon as you click in the app url, you will be redirected to the homepage, where you may find a little introdution and a pretty self explaining tutorial describing each page and funcionality of my app. So, as an introductive page, the homepage is not interactive, it just shows to the user some static content.
The first interactive page is the portfolio page, where you can find my simplified portfolio with the informations about my actual journey as a vet student, but you can also interchange between two tabs and see my detailed portfolio with every single information that i consider important in my professional and academic life.
The third page is the "curiosidades" section, where you may see some probably weird and unusual curiosities that you had no idea were true about the vet world and about animal in general. Also, this page contains a quizz from an external website (i think that quizz is made for veterinarians so you might not undestand a single question hahaha).
The "mundo vet" is the fourth page from this SPA, it shows to the user some informations about the vet scenario in brazil, but also in the entire world, such as sallary, the amount of professionals in the merch and the top5 best vet universities in Brasil.
"Sobre mim" is a page where i talk a bit about myself, my interests, hobbies, what i like or what i dont amongst other things. If you want to know a bit more about me, just do a quick check on that one.
Last but not least, the "contato" page shows you all my contact info, my email, instagram, phone number and others. If you want to contact my, you may use any of the social medias that i inserted there.

## How was it developed?

You'll know more about that when I complete that project and put it online.
